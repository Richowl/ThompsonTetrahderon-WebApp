# ThompsonTetrahderon-WebApp
This script builds and displays an interactive Thompson Tetrahedron you can use for studying / as a reference for dislocation slip systems in FCC crystals.

Interactivity includes displaying specific slip system info on click,
coordinate axis rotation, hiding and displaying specific features, and
displaying a twinning (mirror) Thompson Tetrahedron following a (111) twinning plane.
